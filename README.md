# Media Foundation Samples

These samples are derived from here https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Media-extensions-sample-7b466096 and have been updated to work with VS2019 and UWP.

If Microsoft is listening, these are important samples that should be provided as C++/WinRT equivalents.  If anyone does do the C++/WinRT conversion, please drop a note here with a pointer to the new repo.
